Some people have said some really nice things about my work! Here are a few:

- `Ned Batchelder <http://nedbatchelder.com/>`_, author of coverage.py said
  in `an interview <http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2015/03/09/pydev-of-the-week-ned-batchelder/>`_,

      Q: Which Python libraries are your favorite (core or 3rd party)?

      [...] Iâ€™m delighted to continue to find little gems like blessed [...]
      They demonstrate the craftsmanship that Python developers bring to their
      work, and a dedication to making tools that help others.

- Regarding implementing the entire set of RFC's for the telnet protocol,
  `Guido Von Rossum says <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.tulip/297>`_:

      Wow. Jaw-dropping wow.
