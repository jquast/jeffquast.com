title: Without a $JOB or $HOME
---

I left my ``$JOB`` at the end of 2019 after a year-long battle against an
ever-expanding "open office" plan, where my personal productivity reached an
all-time low. The sound dB levels exceeded those of a common restaurant, and Co2
levels so high as to cause `air quality equipment`_ to alert.  That is not a
kind environment for serious engineering and career growth, it most certainly
only benefits the loudest. It enforces a "loud culture", where only the most
abrasive employees benefit by an audience held hostage.

But more importantly, it caused a condition of anxiety that was new and
terrifying for me. I am relieved for my future self that this condition was
cured by leaving.

I'm a very happy person again, and all it took was a few hours of peace and
quiet during my work day, especially during times of performing careful and
difficult work (on `many FOSS initiatives`_, since my depature).  So if I have
anyone's attention, I'd like to make one final plea for office space and
quietude: don't wait for a pandemic to consider only the *physical* health of
your employees. Take care of their *mental* health, too.

Today's economy demands that we spend more time at our ``$JOBS`` than with our
families and friends, so in return, employers could please try to better consider
the impact that their workplace environment has on the health of their employees.

Losing my $HOME
===============

Shortly after my recovery from anxiety this spring, I lost my rental ``$HOME``
when my landlord decided they needed that space for their family due to the
stay-at-home order. March was an especially difficult time to find a home,
especially while unemployed, so I have relocated to stay with family.

Looking for work
================

I am effectively both *unemployed and homeless* -- Woah!

**If you are employing, I am looking**, and willing to relocate.  Please take a
look at my resume_!  I have about 19 years of Python and about 23 years of Linux
experience.
