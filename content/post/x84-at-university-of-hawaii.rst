x84 at University of Hawaiʻi
============================

I saw an anonymous user login to my telnet host `1984.ws <telnet://1984.ws>`_
which is an open source Python Telnet BBS Server that I author and host.  I
joined him in chat, and he informed me that he didn't know where he was, but
that he was **instructed** to telnet to this host as part of his course lab for
Linux Systems Administration at the University of Hawaiʻi!

I do not know the instructor, Milica Barjaktarovic, so I don't know *why* my
system was recommended, but I'm honored to have my system as part of a University
curriculum even though I dropped out of school myself :)
